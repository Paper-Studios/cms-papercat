# Promotional Website with React Bricks as a CMS

A Content Management System (CMS) benefits clients by enabling easy, user-friendly content updates without requiring any technical expertise. It also benefits developers who want to control what a client can manipulate without breaking responsiveness and will maintain integrity of the UI design.
While Wix, SquareSpace, and Wordpress may come to mind when thinking about a CMS, [React Bricks](https://reactbricks.com) offers a unique and fully customizable alternative that uses plain React components and CSS modules inside both a front-end and admin dashboard.

`/games`<br>
